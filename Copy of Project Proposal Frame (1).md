### **1\. App Idea**

Our game, *Slug Chase*, is a twist on the classic *Snake* game, where instead of the character itself growing longer, the slug's trail extends with each item consumed. The slug character navigates the screen eating “poop” items that increase the length of its trail. Players must skillfully avoid colliding with their own trail as it gets progressively longer, creating an exciting challenge that grows with each level.

### **2\. Target Audience**

This game is designed for ages 10-18 who enjoy casual and skill-based games. Fans of arcade-style games and simple yet challenging mechanics, especially those familiar with *Snake*, will find *Slug Chase* both fun and nostalgic.

### **3\. Goals and Vision**

The goal is to create a lighthearted, fun, and addictive game that brings a unique twist to the familiar *Snake* gameplay. We want players to experience an engaging challenge as they manage an ever-lengthening trail while collecting items. Our vision is a game that’s accessible yet progressively challenging, keeping players coming back for more.

### **4\. Key Features**

* **Single-player mode with multiple levels**: The game progresses through increasingly challenging levels.  
* **Unique gameplay mechanics**: The trail grows longer instead of the character itself, adding a twist to traditional *Snake* gameplay.  
* **Consumable items**: Players collect "poop" items that add to their trail length.  
* **Score tracking**: Players can track their score based on the number of items collected and levels cleared.  
* **Colorful, cartoonish graphics** to enhance the lighthearted and whimsical tone of the game.

### **5\. Success Criteria**

*Slug Chase* will be considered successful if:

* The game is free from major bugs, with smooth and responsive controls.  
* Players find the mechanics unique and challenging, providing a twist on classic gameplay.  
* There is a steady increase in difficulty across levels, giving players a sense of accomplishment.  
* The game offers enough replayability and fun to keep players engaged.

### **6\. Technical Requirements**

* **Platform**: Developed for PC, with keyboard controls (arrow keys for movement).  
* **Performance**: Game should maintain a smooth 60 FPS.  
* **Save functionality**: Players can save progress and resume from their last checkpoint.  
* **Low memory usage** to ensure smooth graphics and gameplay, even as trail length increases.
