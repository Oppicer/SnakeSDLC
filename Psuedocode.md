### **1\. App Idea**

*Slug Chase* is an arcade-style game where players control a slug that moves around a screen, eating trash items to grow a slime trail. As the slug consumes more trash, its trail grows longer, making the game progressively harder. The goal is to eat as much trash as possible while avoiding collisions with the growing slime trail or any other obstacles in the environment.

### **2\. Target Audience**

This game is designed for players ages 8-16 who enjoy simple yet challenging arcade-style games. It will appeal to those who like fast-paced gameplay and enjoy games where reaction time and strategy are important. Fans of classic snake-style games will find *Slug Chase* engaging, along with players who enjoy nature-themed, casual games.

### **3\. Goals and Vision**

The goal is to create a fun, engaging game that combines elements of traditional arcade games with a unique theme. We want the game to be accessible for beginners while offering enough challenge to keep players entertained. The slime trail mechanic adds strategic depth, making it more exciting as the game progresses. Our vision is for a casual game that encourages replayability with increasing difficulty and fun gameplay.
