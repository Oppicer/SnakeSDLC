# **Slug Chase**

## **Project Description**
*Slug Chase* is a twist on the classic *Snake* game. Instead of the character itself growing longer, the slug leaves an extending trail with each "poop" item it consumes. Players must skillfully navigate the screen, avoiding their own trail as it gets progressively longer. This lighthearted, cartoonish game provides a unique challenge that increases with each level, combining fun gameplay with a nostalgic arcade vibe.

## **Installation Instructions**
1. Clone or download the *Slug Chase* project from the repository.
2. Navigate to the game folder on your PC.
3. Open the game file and run `slug_chase.exe` to start the game.
4. Ensure your system meets the minimum requirements:
   - **Operating System**: Windows 10 or higher
   - **Processor**: Intel i5 or equivalent

## **Usage Instructions**
- **Controls**:
